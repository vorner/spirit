[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/vorner/spirit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vorner/spirit)

A helper to make creating and configuring unix daemons easier.

See the [docs](https://docs.rs/spirit), the [examples](https://github.com/vorner/spirit/tree/master/examples) and a [tutorial](https://vorner.github.io/2018/12/09/Spirit-Tutorial.html) (outdated, but there'll be a new one soon).
