## Looking for contributors and maintainers

This library is too big project for me do in my spare time and I don't have a
direct use case for it now. See [this blog post](https://vorner.github.io/2020/03/01/spring-cleanup.html).

If you want this library to thrive, roll up your sleeves and help. Send PRs,
help reviewing, etc. I'll still be willing fixing serious bugs, doing reviews
and consulting.

Alternatively, I may accept payment to do some development on it.

## The library

(**[API Docs for master][docs]/[User Guide][user-guide]**)

Spirit aims to help with combining configuration and command line parsing,
reloading it at runtime and provides various ready-made helpers for common parts
of configuration like logging.

In other words, it cuts down on glue code between many different libraries and
makes writing unix daemons easier.
