<span class="doccomment">//! Internal details.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! While the other parts of documentation are useful to users of the crate, this part is probably</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! helpful only if you want to look into the code or are curious about how it works internally.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Also note that any of these details may change in future versions and are not part of the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! stability guarantees. Don&#39;t rely on anything here.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Storing the [`Arc`].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The [`Arc`] can be turned into a raw pointer and back. This is abstracted by the [`RefCnt`]</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! trait and it is technically possible to implement it for custom types (this crate also</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! implements it for [`Rc`] and [`Weak`], though the actual usefulness of these is a bit</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! questionable).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The raw pointer is stored inside an [`AtomicPtr`].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Protection of reference counts</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The first idea would be to just use [`AtomicPtr`] with whatever the [`Arc::into_raw`] returns.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Then replacing it would be fine (there&#39;s no need to update ref counts). The load needs to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! increment the reference count ‒ one still stays inside and another is returned to the caller.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This is done by re-creating the Arc from the raw pointer and then cloning it, throwing one</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! instance away (without destroying it).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This approach has a problem. There&#39;s a short time between we read the raw pointer and increment</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the count. If some other thread replaces the stored Arc and throws it away, the ref count could</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! drop to 0, get destroyed and we would be trying to bump ref counts in a ghost, which would be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! totally broken.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! To prevent this, we actually use two approaches in a hybrid manner.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The first one is based on hazard pointers idea, but slightly modified. There&#39;s a global</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! repository of pointers that owe a reference. When someone swaps a pointer, it walks this list</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! and pays all the debts (and takes them out of the repository).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! For simplicity and performance, storing into the repository is fallible. If storing into the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! repository fails (because the thread used up all its own slots, or because the pointer got</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! replaced in just the wrong moment and it can&#39;t confirm the reservation), unlike the full</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! hazard-pointers approach, we don&#39;t retry, but fall back onto secondary strategy.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Each reader registers itself so it can be tracked, but only as a number. Each writer first</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! switches the pointer. Then it takes a snapshot of all the current readers and waits until all of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! them confirm bumping their reference count. Only then the writer returns to the caller, handing</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! it the ownership of the Arc and allowing possible bad things (like being destroyed) to happen to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! it. This has its own disadvantages, so it is only the second approach.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Unsafety</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! All the uses of the unsafe keyword is just to turn the raw pointer back to Arc. It originated</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! from an Arc in the first place, so the only thing to ensure is it is still valid. That means its</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ref count never dropped to 0.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! At the beginning, there&#39;s ref count of 1 stored in the raw pointer (and maybe some others</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! elsewhere, but we can&#39;t rely on these). This 1 stays there for the whole time the pointer is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! stored there. When the arc is replaced, this 1 is returned to the caller, so we just have to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! make sure no more readers access it by that time.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Tracking of readers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The simple way would be to have a count of all readers that could be in the dangerous area</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! between reading the pointer and bumping the reference count. We could „lock“ the ref count by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! incrementing this atomic counter and „unlock“ it when done. The writer would just have to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! busy-wait for this number to drop to 0 ‒ then there are no readers at all. This is safe, but a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! steady inflow of readers could make a writer wait forever.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Therefore, we separate readers into two groups, odd and even ones (see below how). When we see</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! both groups to drop to 0 (not necessarily at the same time, though), we are sure all the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! previous readers were flushed ‒ each of them had to be either odd or even.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! To do that, we define a generation. A generation is a number, incremented at certain times and a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! reader decides by this number if it is odd or even.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! One of the writers may increment the generation when it sees a zero in the next-generation&#39;s</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! group (if the writer sees 0 in the odd group and the current generation is even, all the current</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! writers are even ‒ so it remembers it saw odd-zero and increments the generation, so new readers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! start to appear in the odd group and the even has a chance to drop to zero later on). Only one</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! writer does this switch, but all that witness the zero can remember it.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! We also split the reader threads into shards ‒ we have multiple copies of the counters, which</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! prevents some contention and sharing of the cache lines. The writer reads them all and sums them</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! up.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Leases and debts</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Instead of incrementing the reference count, the pointer reference can be owed. In such case, it</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! is recorded into a global storage. As each thread has its own storage (the global storage is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! composed of multiple thread storages), the readers don&#39;t contend. When the pointer is no longer</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! in use, the debt is erased.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The writer pays all the existing debts, therefore the reader have the full Arc with ref count at</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! that time. The reader is made aware the debt was paid and decrements the reference count.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Memory orders</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Synchronizing the data pointed to by the pointer.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! We have AcqRel (well, SeqCst, but that&#39;s included) on the swap and Acquire on the loads. In case</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! of the double read around the debt allocation, we do that on the *second*, because of ABA.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! That&#39;s also why that SeqCst on the allocation of debt itself is not enough.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## The generation lock</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Second, the dangerous area when we borrowed the pointer but haven&#39;t yet incremented its ref</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! count needs to stay between incrementing and decrementing the reader count (in either group). To</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! accomplish that, using Acquire on the increment and Release on the decrement would be enough.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The loads in the writer use Acquire to complete the edge and make sure no part of the dangerous</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! area leaks outside of it in the writers view. This Acquire, however, forms the edge only with</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the *latest* decrement. By making both the increment and decrement AcqRel, we effectively chain</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the edges together.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Now the hard part :-). We need to ensure that whatever zero a writer sees is not stale in the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! sense that it happened before the switch of the pointer. In other words, we need to make sure</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! that at the time we start to look for the zeroes, we already see all the current readers. To do</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! that, we need to synchronize the time lines of the pointer itself and the corresponding group</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! counters. As these are separate, unrelated, atomics, it calls for SeqCst ‒ on the swap and on</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the increment. This&#39;ll guarantee that they&#39;ll know which happened first (either increment or the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! swap), making a base line for the following operations (load of the pointer or looking for</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! zeroes).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Memory orders around debts</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The linked list of debt nodes only grows. The shape of the list (existence of nodes) is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! synchronized through Release on creation and Acquire on load on the head pointer.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The debts work similar to locks ‒ Acquire and Release make all the pointer manipulation at the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! interval where it is written down. However, we use the SeqCst on the allocation of the debt for</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the same reason we do so with the generation lock.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! In case the writer pays the debt, it sees the new enough data (for the same reasons the stale</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! zeroes are not seen). The reference count on the Arc is AcqRel and makes sure it is not</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! destroyed too soon. The writer traverses all the slots, therefore they don&#39;t need to synchronize</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! with each other.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Orderings on the rest</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! We don&#39;t really care much if we use a stale generation number ‒ it only works to route the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! readers into one or another bucket, but even if it was completely wrong, it would only slow the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! waiting for 0 down. So, the increments of it are just hints.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! All other operations can be Relaxed (they either only claim something, which doesn&#39;t need to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! synchronize with anything else, or they are failed attempts at something ‒ and another attempt</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! will be made, the successful one will do the necessary synchronization).</span>
