<span class="doccomment">//! Performance characteristics.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! There are several performance advantages of [`ArcSwap`] over [`RwLock`].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Lock-free readers</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! All the read operations are always [lock-free]. Most of the time, they are actually</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [wait-free], the notable exception is the first [`load`] access in each thread (across all the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! instances of [`ArcSwap`]), as it sets up some thread-local data structures.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Whenever the documentation talks about *contention* in the context of [`ArcSwap`], it talks</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! about contention on the CPU level ‒ multiple cores having to deal with accessing the same cache</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! line. This slows things down (compared to each one accessing its own cache line), but an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! eventual progress is still guaranteed and the cost is significantly lower than parking threads</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! as with mutex-style contention.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Unfortunately writers are *not* [lock-free]. A reader stuck (suspended/killed) in a critical</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! section (few instructions long in case of [`load`]) may block a writer from completion.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Nevertheless, a steady inflow of new readers nor other writers will not block the writer.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Speeds</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The base line speed of read operations is similar to using an *uncontended* [`Mutex`].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! However, [`load`] suffers no contention from any other read operations and only slight</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ones during updates. The [`load_full`] operation is additionally contended only on</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the reference count of the [`Arc`] inside ‒ so, in general, while [`Mutex`] rapidly</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! loses its performance when being in active use by multiple threads at once and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [`RwLock`] is slow to start with, [`ArcSwap`] mostly keeps its performance even when read by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! many threads in parallel.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Write operations are considered expensive. A write operation is more expensive than access to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! an *uncontended* [`Mutex`] and on some architectures even slower than uncontended</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [`RwLock`]. However, it is faster than either under contention.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! There are some (very unscientific) [benchmarks] within the source code of the library.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The exact numbers are highly dependant on the machine used (both absolute numbers and relative</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! between different data structures). Not only architectures have a huge impact (eg. x86 vs ARM),</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! but even AMD vs. Intel or two different Intel processors. Therefore, if what matters is more</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the speed than the wait-free guarantees, you&#39;re advised to do your own measurements.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Further speed improvements may be gained by the use of the [`Cache`].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Consistency</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The combination of [wait-free] guarantees of readers and no contention between concurrent</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [`load`]s provides *consistent* performance characteristics of the synchronization mechanism.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This might be important for soft-realtime applications (the CPU-level contention caused by a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! recent update/write operation might be problematic for some hard-realtime cases, though).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## Choosing the right reading operation</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! There are several load operations available. While the general go-to one should be</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [`load`], there may be situations in which the others are a better match.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The [`load`] usually only borrows the instance from the shared [`ArcSwap`]. This makes</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! it faster, because different threads don&#39;t contend on the reference count. There are two</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! situations when this borrow isn&#39;t possible. If the content gets changed, all existing</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [`Guard`]s are promoted to contain an owned instance. The promotion is done by the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! writer, but the readers still need to decrement the reference counts of the old instance when</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! they no longer use it, contending on the count.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The other situation derives from internal implementation. The number of borrows each thread can</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! have at each time (across all [`Guard`]s) is limited. If this limit is exceeded, an onwed</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! instance is created instead.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Therefore, if you intend to hold onto the loaded value for extended time span, you may prefer</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! [`load_full`]. It loads the pointer instance ([`Arc`]) without borrowing, which is</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! slower (because of the possible contention on the reference count), but doesn&#39;t consume one of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the borrow slots, which will make it more likely for following [`load`]s to have a slot</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! available. Similarly, if some API needs an owned `Arc`, [`load_full`] is more convenient and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! potentially faster then first [`load`]ing and then cloning that [`Arc`].</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Additionally, it is possible to use a [`Cache`] to get further speed improvement at the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! cost of less comfortable API and possibly keeping the older values alive for longer than</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! necessary.</span>
