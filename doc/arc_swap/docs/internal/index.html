<p>While the other parts of documentation are useful to users of the crate, this part is probably
helpful only if you want to look into the code or are curious about how it works internally.</p>
<p>Also note that any of these details may change in future versions and are not part of the
stability guarantees. Don't rely on anything here.</p>
<h1 id="storing-the-arc" class="section-header"><a href="#storing-the-arc">Storing the <code>Arc</code>.</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a> can be turned into a raw pointer and back. This is abstracted by the <a href="../../../arc_swap/trait.RefCnt.html"><code>RefCnt</code></a>
trait and it is technically possible to implement it for custom types (this crate also
implements it for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Weak.html"><code>Weak</code></a>, though the actual usefulness of these is a bit
questionable).</p>
<p>The raw pointer is stored inside an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicPtr.html"><code>AtomicPtr</code></a>.</p>
<h1 id="protection-of-reference-counts" class="section-header"><a href="#protection-of-reference-counts">Protection of reference counts</a></h1>
<p>The first idea would be to just use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicPtr.html"><code>AtomicPtr</code></a> with whatever the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Arc.html#method.into_raw"><code>Arc::into_raw</code></a> returns.
Then replacing it would be fine (there's no need to update ref counts). The load needs to
increment the reference count ‒ one still stays inside and another is returned to the caller.
This is done by re-creating the Arc from the raw pointer and then cloning it, throwing one
instance away (without destroying it).</p>
<p>This approach has a problem. There's a short time between we read the raw pointer and increment
the count. If some other thread replaces the stored Arc and throws it away, the ref count could
drop to 0, get destroyed and we would be trying to bump ref counts in a ghost, which would be
totally broken.</p>
<p>To prevent this, we actually use two approaches in a hybrid manner.</p>
<p>The first one is based on hazard pointers idea, but slightly modified. There's a global
repository of pointers that owe a reference. When someone swaps a pointer, it walks this list
and pays all the debts (and takes them out of the repository).</p>
<p>For simplicity and performance, storing into the repository is fallible. If storing into the
repository fails (because the thread used up all its own slots, or because the pointer got
replaced in just the wrong moment and it can't confirm the reservation), unlike the full
hazard-pointers approach, we don't retry, but fall back onto secondary strategy.</p>
<p>Each reader registers itself so it can be tracked, but only as a number. Each writer first
switches the pointer. Then it takes a snapshot of all the current readers and waits until all of
them confirm bumping their reference count. Only then the writer returns to the caller, handing
it the ownership of the Arc and allowing possible bad things (like being destroyed) to happen to
it. This has its own disadvantages, so it is only the second approach.</p>
<h1 id="unsafety" class="section-header"><a href="#unsafety">Unsafety</a></h1>
<p>All the uses of the unsafe keyword is just to turn the raw pointer back to Arc. It originated
from an Arc in the first place, so the only thing to ensure is it is still valid. That means its
ref count never dropped to 0.</p>
<p>At the beginning, there's ref count of 1 stored in the raw pointer (and maybe some others
elsewhere, but we can't rely on these). This 1 stays there for the whole time the pointer is
stored there. When the arc is replaced, this 1 is returned to the caller, so we just have to
make sure no more readers access it by that time.</p>
<h1 id="tracking-of-readers" class="section-header"><a href="#tracking-of-readers">Tracking of readers</a></h1>
<p>The simple way would be to have a count of all readers that could be in the dangerous area
between reading the pointer and bumping the reference count. We could „lock“ the ref count by
incrementing this atomic counter and „unlock“ it when done. The writer would just have to
busy-wait for this number to drop to 0 ‒ then there are no readers at all. This is safe, but a
steady inflow of readers could make a writer wait forever.</p>
<p>Therefore, we separate readers into two groups, odd and even ones (see below how). When we see
both groups to drop to 0 (not necessarily at the same time, though), we are sure all the
previous readers were flushed ‒ each of them had to be either odd or even.</p>
<p>To do that, we define a generation. A generation is a number, incremented at certain times and a
reader decides by this number if it is odd or even.</p>
<p>One of the writers may increment the generation when it sees a zero in the next-generation's
group (if the writer sees 0 in the odd group and the current generation is even, all the current
writers are even ‒ so it remembers it saw odd-zero and increments the generation, so new readers
start to appear in the odd group and the even has a chance to drop to zero later on). Only one
writer does this switch, but all that witness the zero can remember it.</p>
<p>We also split the reader threads into shards ‒ we have multiple copies of the counters, which
prevents some contention and sharing of the cache lines. The writer reads them all and sums them
up.</p>
<h1 id="leases-and-debts" class="section-header"><a href="#leases-and-debts">Leases and debts</a></h1>
<p>Instead of incrementing the reference count, the pointer reference can be owed. In such case, it
is recorded into a global storage. As each thread has its own storage (the global storage is
composed of multiple thread storages), the readers don't contend. When the pointer is no longer
in use, the debt is erased.</p>
<p>The writer pays all the existing debts, therefore the reader have the full Arc with ref count at
that time. The reader is made aware the debt was paid and decrements the reference count.</p>
<h1 id="memory-orders" class="section-header"><a href="#memory-orders">Memory orders</a></h1><h2 id="synchronizing-the-data-pointed-to-by-the-pointer" class="section-header"><a href="#synchronizing-the-data-pointed-to-by-the-pointer">Synchronizing the data pointed to by the pointer.</a></h2>
<p>We have AcqRel (well, SeqCst, but that's included) on the swap and Acquire on the loads. In case
of the double read around the debt allocation, we do that on the <em>second</em>, because of ABA.
That's also why that SeqCst on the allocation of debt itself is not enough.</p>
<h2 id="the-generation-lock" class="section-header"><a href="#the-generation-lock">The generation lock</a></h2>
<p>Second, the dangerous area when we borrowed the pointer but haven't yet incremented its ref
count needs to stay between incrementing and decrementing the reader count (in either group). To
accomplish that, using Acquire on the increment and Release on the decrement would be enough.
The loads in the writer use Acquire to complete the edge and make sure no part of the dangerous
area leaks outside of it in the writers view. This Acquire, however, forms the edge only with
the <em>latest</em> decrement. By making both the increment and decrement AcqRel, we effectively chain
the edges together.</p>
<p>Now the hard part :-). We need to ensure that whatever zero a writer sees is not stale in the
sense that it happened before the switch of the pointer. In other words, we need to make sure
that at the time we start to look for the zeroes, we already see all the current readers. To do
that, we need to synchronize the time lines of the pointer itself and the corresponding group
counters. As these are separate, unrelated, atomics, it calls for SeqCst ‒ on the swap and on
the increment. This'll guarantee that they'll know which happened first (either increment or the
swap), making a base line for the following operations (load of the pointer or looking for
zeroes).</p>
<h1 id="memory-orders-around-debts" class="section-header"><a href="#memory-orders-around-debts">Memory orders around debts</a></h1>
<p>The linked list of debt nodes only grows. The shape of the list (existence of nodes) is
synchronized through Release on creation and Acquire on load on the head pointer.</p>
<p>The debts work similar to locks ‒ Acquire and Release make all the pointer manipulation at the
interval where it is written down. However, we use the SeqCst on the allocation of the debt for
the same reason we do so with the generation lock.</p>
<p>In case the writer pays the debt, it sees the new enough data (for the same reasons the stale
zeroes are not seen). The reference count on the Arc is AcqRel and makes sure it is not
destroyed too soon. The writer traverses all the slots, therefore they don't need to synchronize
with each other.</p>
<h1 id="orderings-on-the-rest" class="section-header"><a href="#orderings-on-the-rest">Orderings on the rest</a></h1>
<p>We don't really care much if we use a stale generation number ‒ it only works to route the
readers into one or another bucket, but even if it was completely wrong, it would only slow the
waiting for 0 down. So, the increments of it are just hints.</p>
<p>All other operations can be Relaxed (they either only claim something, which doesn't need to
synchronize with anything else, or they are failed attempts at something ‒ and another attempt
will be made, the successful one will do the necessary synchronization).</p>
