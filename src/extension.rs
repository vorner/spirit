//! Interfaces for extending the [`Spirit`] and [`Builder`] with callbacks.
//!
//! Both the [`Spirit`] and [`Builder`] types allow registering callbacks. The [`Extensible`] trait
//! describes the interface for registering them.
//!
//! Furthermore, [`Extensible`] is also implemented for `Result`s containing them. This allows
//! chaining the building without manually handling the errors. The error then can be handled by
//! [`Builder::run`][crate::Builder::run] and logged, without making a distinction if it comes from
//! the setup or application run.
//!
//! Some libraries might want to provide bits of functionality that need to register several
//! different callbacks at once to work properly. This is described by the [`Extension`] trait.
//!
//! In addition, the module contains few useful extensions that may be plugged in.
//!

/// when setting things up and when everything is already running (but see notes at various
/// methods, sometimes there are subtle differences ‒ specifically, it is not possible to do some
/// things when the application already started).
///
/// In addition, this is also implemented on `Result<Extensible, AnyError>`. This allows the caller
/// to postpone all error handling for later or even leave it up to the
/// [`Builder::run`][crate::SpiritBuilder::run`] to handle them.

/// # Deadlocks
///
/// In general, it is not possible to register callbacks from within callbacks. Internally, the

/// manipulating and running them. Such attempt to register a callback from within a callback will
/// lead to a deadlock (this restriction might be lifted in the future).

///
/// ```rust
/// use spirit::{Empty, Spirit};
/// use spirit::prelude::*;
///
/// // This creates a Builder
/// Spirit::<Empty, Empty>::new()
///     // This returns Result<Builder, AnyError>. But we don't handle the error here, it propagates
///     // further in the call chain.
///     .run_before(|_spirit| Ok(()))
///     // This run_before is on the Result<Builder, AnyError>. If the first one returned an error,
///     // nothing would happen and the error would thread on. So, this works like implicit .and_then,
///     // but without the inconvenience.
///     //
///     // (This also returns Result<Builder, AnyError>, not Result<Result<Builder, AnyError>,

/// The basic extension trait.
///
/// It allows being plugged into a [`Builder`][crate::Builder] or [`Spirit`][crate::Spirit] and
/// modifying it in an arbitrary way.
///
/// It is more common to apply the helper by the
/// [`with`][Extensible::with] or [`with_singleton`][Extensible::with_singleton] method than
/// directly.
///
/// There's an implementation of `Extension` for `FnOnce(Extensible) -> Result<Extensible, AnyError>`,
/// so extensions can be either custom types or just closures (which are often more convenient than
/// defining an empty type and the implementation).
///
/// It is better to define the extension in a generic way (eg. accepting any type that is
/// [`Extensible`]) instead of eg. a [`Builder`][crate::Builder] directly. Note that sometimes it
/// is needed to restrict the acceptable [`Extensible`]s to the base ones, with `Ok = E`, like in
/// the example below. They'll still be possible to apply to `Result`s.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use spirit::{AnyError ,Empty, Spirit};
/// use spirit::extension::{Extension, Extensible};
/// use spirit::prelude::*;
///
/// struct CfgPrint;
///
/// impl<E: Extensible<Ok = E>> Extension<E> for CfgPrint {
///     fn apply(self, ext: E) -> Result<E, AnyError> {
///         Ok(ext.on_config(|_opts, _config| println!("Config changed")))
