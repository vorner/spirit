/// is needed to make the interface flexible ‒ the [`Pipeline`] can describe a lot of different use
/// cases on top of completely different types and [`Resource`]s.
///
/// That, however, brigs certain limitations that you might want to know about:
///
/// * All the methods and types here are very rich in terms of type parameters and trait bounds.
/// * The error messages are quite long and hard to read as a result.
/// * Sometimes, `rustc` even gives up on producing the helpful hints as a result of the above.
///   There's a workaround for that in the form of the [`check`][Pipeline::check] method.
/// * As of rust stable 1.32, extracting references (through the [`extract`][Pipeline::extract] and
///   [`extract_cfg`][Pipeline::extract_cfg]) doesn't work. Either use a newer compiler or extract
///   only owned types (eg. `clone` ‒ it should be generally cheap, because these are parts of
///   configuration the user have written and it needs to be extracted only when reloading the
///   configuration).
/// * As the pipeline is being constructed through the builder pattern, it is possible the types
///   don't line up during the construction. If you do not make it align by the end, it will not be
///   possible to use the pipeline inside the
///   [`Extensible::with`][crate::extension::Extensible::with].
///
/// In general, each [`Fragment`] comes with an example containing its *canonical* pipeline.
/// Copy-pasting and possibly modifying that is probably the easiest way to overcome the above
/// limitations.
///
/// # Creation order
///
/// The pipeline describes a mostly linear process that happens every time a configuration is
/// loaded. Therefore, it helps readability if the builder pattern of the [`Pipeline`] is written
/// in the same order as the operations happen. In addition, not all orders of the builder pattern
/// will be accepted, due to how the trait bounds are composed.
///
/// While not all steps are needed every time, the ones present should be written in this order:
///
/// * [`new`][Pipeline::new]: This is the constructor and sets the name of the pipeline.
/// * [`extract`][Pipeline::extract] or [`extract_cfg`][Pipeline::extract_cfg]: This sets the
///   closure (or other [`Extractor`]) the pipeline will use. This also sets the [`Fragment`] tied
///   to the pipeline and presets the [`Driver`] and the [`Installer`] (though the [`Installer`]
///   maybe something useless, since not all [`Fragment`]s create something directly installable).
/// * [`set_driver`][Pipeline::set_driver]: This overrides the default [`Driver`] provided by the
///   [`Fragment`] to something user-provided. It is generally rare to use this.
/// * [`transform`][Pipeline::transform]: This applies (another) transformation. It makes sense to
///   call multiple times to chain multiple transformations together. They are applied in the same
///   order as they are added.
/// * [`install`][Pipeline::install]: Sets or overrides the [`Installer`] the pipeline uses. This
///   is sometimes necessary, but sometimes either the [`Fragment`] or one of the
///   [`Transformation`]s provides one.

/// Trait alias for one concrete lifetime of a [`Pipeline`].
///
/// Pipelines are fed with only references to the configuration and command line options and a lot
/// of the processing can happen through references only. As a result, most of the trait bounds in
/// around the pipelines are [HRTBs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html).
///
/// This is an internal trait alias, describing the [`Pipeline`] bounds for a single concrete
/// lifetime. This makes the bounds of the [`Extension`] implementation actually almost manageable
/// instead of completely crackpot insane.
///
/// However, as the user is not able to get the hands on any instance implementing this trait, it
/// is quite useless and is public only through the trait bounds.
