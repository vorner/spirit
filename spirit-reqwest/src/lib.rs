//! This helps with configuring the [`reqwest`] [`Client`].
//!
//! This is part of the [`spirit`] system.
//!
//! There are two levels of support. The first one is just letting the [`Spirit`] to load the
//! [`ReqwestClient`] configuration fragment and calling one of its methods to create the
//! [`Client`] or others.
//!
//! The other, more convenient way, is pairing an extractor function with the
//! [`AtomicClient`][futures::AtomicClient] and
//! letting [`Spirit`] keep an up to date version of [`Client`] in there at all times.
//!
//! # The split and features
//!
//! The [`ReqwestClient`] lives at the top of the crate. However, [`reqwest`] provides both
//! blocking and async flavours of the HTTP client. For that reason, this crate provides two
//! submodules, each with the relevant support (note that the name of the async one is [`futures`],
//! because `async` is a keyword). The pipeline is configured with the relevant `IntoClient`
//! transformation and installed into the relevant `AtomicClient`.
//!
//! Features enable parts of the functionality here and correspond to some of the features of
//! [`reqwest`]. In particular:
//!
//! * `gzip`: The `enable-gzip` configuration option.
//! * `brotli`: The `enable-brotli` configuration option.
//! * `native-tls`: The `tls-identity`, `tls-identity-password` and `tls-accept-invalid-hostnames`
//!   options.
//! * `blocking`: The whole [`blocking`] module and methods for creating the blocking client and
//!   builder.
//!
//! # Porting from the 0.3 version
//!
//! * You may need to enable certain features (if you want to keep using the blocking API, you need
//!   the `blocking` feature, but you also may want the `native-tls` and `gzip` features to get the
//!   same feature coverage).
//! * Part of what you used moved to the submodule, but otherwise should have same or similar API
//! * The pipeline needs the addition of `.transform(IntoClient)` between config extraction and
//!   installation, to choose if you are interested in blocking or async flavour.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature = "blocking")] mod example {
//! use serde::Deserialize;
//! use spirit::{Empty, Pipeline, Spirit};
//! use spirit::prelude::*;
